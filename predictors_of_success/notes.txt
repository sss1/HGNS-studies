1) The email defined "change in AHI" as "pre minus post AHI"; should be "post minus pre AHI", right?
2) For BMI, I used "BMI - preop" and discarded "latest BMI".
3) The DISE values are mostly (>90%) missing. Is it reasonable to assume this is missing completely at random? If not, we should probably use regression imputation, although this is a bit more work.
4) What do the Oropharynx values 0, 1, and 2 correspond to? Are the completely discrete categories? Or, e.g., ordinal? Is there a reason 0 and 1 are grouped in the formula? Why are there very few patients with Oropharynx 2? 
5) Is the datapoint with preop_AHI=178 an error? It seems too high; the next largest value it 105. I've removed it in this analysis.
6) For supine dependent apnea, I used supine and non-supine AHIs only to identify the supine-dependent subgroup, and then ran the same analyses (using overall AHIs) on this subgroup.
